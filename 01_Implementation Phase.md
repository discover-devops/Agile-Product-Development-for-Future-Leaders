#  **Implementation Phase (in Product context)**

##  **Definition**

The **Implementation Phase** is where the **actual product development happens** — coding, configuration, integration, and building the product features that were planned.
It is often referred to as the **Execution phase** in SDLC.

---

##  **Key Activities**

1. **Development (Coding)**

   * Engineers write code based on design + requirements.
   * Example: Amazon developers coding the “1-Click Checkout” feature.

2. **Integration**

   * Different modules or components are combined.
   * Example: Checkout integrates with payment gateway, cart, and inventory systems.

3. **Unit & Integration Testing (initial)**

   * Developers test their own modules before handing off to QA.

4. **Collaboration**

   * Daily stand-ups (in Agile).
   * Continuous integration using tools like GitHub/Jenkins.

---

##  **Output**

* A **working product increment** (not necessarily the full product).
* In Agile: at the end of each Sprint, you should have a **potentially shippable product increment**.

---

##  **Example (Amazon)**

Let’s say the roadmap says: *“Add grocery delivery.”*

* **Implementation looks like:**

  * Dev team builds “Add to Cart” for groceries.
  * Backend connects to local store inventory APIs.
  * Payment service updated to handle perishable items.
  * Initial testing to ensure it all works together.

By end of this phase, Amazon has a **working grocery delivery feature** ready for QA & UAT.
