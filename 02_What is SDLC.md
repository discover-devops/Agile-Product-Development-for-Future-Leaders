###  What is SDLC?

**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.
It is a **structured process** followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deliver high-quality software efficiently.

---

###  SDLC Phases (Typical Steps):

1. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation / Coding**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance & Support**

Each phase has defined inputs and deliverables and aims to improve the efficiency, quality, and manageability of software development.

##  SDLC Models

SDLC Models are **methodologies** that define **how** the software development phases are executed.
Examples: Waterfall, Agile, V-Model, Spiral, Iterative, Big Bang, etc.

##  Waterfall Model (One of the oldest SDLC models)

**Definition**:
The **Waterfall Model** is a **linear and sequential approach** to software development. Each phase must be **completed before the next phase** begins.

###  Phases in Waterfall:

1. **Requirement Gathering**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

###  Pros of Waterfall Model

| Advantage                                 | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Simple & Easy to Use                   | Clear structure and well-defined stages.                   |
|  Documentation-heavy                    | Good for regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, banking). |
|  Early Detection of Requirements Issues | Requirements are fully defined before coding starts.       |
|  Easy to Manage                         | Progress flows in one direction, so it's easier to track.  |

###  Cons of Waterfall Model

| Limitation                       | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  No Flexibility                | Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.       |
|  Late Testing                  | Bugs are discovered late in the cycle, often after major development. |
|  Poor for Unknown Requirements | Not ideal for projects where requirements evolve over time.           |
|  Costly Fixes                  | Mistakes found late are expensive to fix.                             |

###  When to Use Waterfall

* Requirements are **clearly defined** and **unlikely to change**.
* Project is **short-term** or **low risk**.
* You work in industries needing **heavy documentation** or **compliance**.
