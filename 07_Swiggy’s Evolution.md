#  **Storytelling Script – Swiggy’s Evolution**

“Let me tell you the story of **Swiggy**.

Back in 2014, food delivery in India was a mess. You had to **call the restaurant**, the line was always busy, and you had no clue if your food would actually arrive. Zomato was around, but it was mostly a **restaurant discovery app**, not a delivery company.

Swiggy saw the gap. They said — *what if we not only list restaurants, but also control the delivery fleet ourselves?*

That’s how **Swiggy Food Delivery** was born. A simple app → you open it, pick a restaurant, place an order, and Swiggy’s delivery boy shows up at your door. No hassle, no waiting, no uncertainty.
 The first product solved **convenience + reliability**.

Now fast forward to 2020. The pandemic hits. People are stuck at home. What’s the biggest problem? **Groceries.**
Swiggy asked: *If we can deliver food in 30 minutes, why not groceries?*

That’s how **Swiggy Instamart** was launched. Using the same delivery network, they started delivering milk, bread, snacks, vegetables — literally in **15 minutes**.
The second product solved **instant need for essentials**.

And then came **Swiggy Genie**. This one’s interesting. The team realized customers were already asking delivery boys: *“Can you also pick up a document from my office?”* or *“Can you drop this parcel to my friend’s house?”*

Swiggy saw the pattern. They said — *why only food and groceries? Why not make our fleet a general-purpose logistics network?*
That’s how Genie was born — you could send anything, anywhere, within the city.
The third product solved **flexibility beyond food**.

So if you see the **journey**:

* First they solved *hunger* (food).
* Then they solved *daily essentials* (Instamart).
* Finally, they solved *urban logistics* (Genie).

The magic here is not just about adding features. It’s about **leveraging the same core strength — their delivery fleet — to keep solving bigger problems for the customer.**

That’s what product evolution looks like.”
