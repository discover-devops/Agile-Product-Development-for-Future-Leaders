### 1️ **Product Manager (PM)** – *The Visionary*

* Defines **what problem to solve** and **why it matters**.
* Owns product vision, roadmap, and business case.
* Works as the “CEO of the product” (but without authority over teams).
* Example: At Swiggy, PM decides → *“We should launch Instamart to solve instant grocery needs.”*

---

### 2️ **Designer (UX/UI)** – *The Storyteller for Users*

* Translates ideas into **user-friendly experiences**.
* Creates wireframes, prototypes, visual design.
* Ensures the product is intuitive, beautiful, and accessible.
* Example: Designer ensures Swiggy’s app is so simple that even a first-time user can order in 3 clicks.

---

### 3️ **Engineer (Developer)** – *The Builder*

* Turns requirements & designs into **working code**.
* Works on frontend (what user sees), backend (logic, servers), databases, APIs.
* Example: Engineer builds Swiggy’s delivery tracking system.

---

### 4️ **Quality Analyst (QA / Tester)** – *The Gatekeeper*

* Ensures product works as expected (no bugs, smooth flow).
* Tests features, automation, performance.
* Example: QA tests whether Swiggy payment actually deducts once and doesn’t double-charge.

---

### 5️ **Stakeholders** – *The Sponsors & Partners*

* People who have a **business interest** in the product.
* Can be customers, business leaders, investors, or regulators.
* Provide funding, direction, and constraints.
* Example: Swiggy’s investors push for faster monetization → influence decisions like launching subscriptions.

##  Teaching Analogy

> “Think of product development like making a movie:

* **PM = Producer/Director** (vision, story)
* **Designer = Scriptwriter + Set designer** (experience)
* **Engineer = Actors & Crew** (builds it)
* **QA = Editor** (ensures quality before release)
* **Stakeholders = Investors & Audience** (fund & validate success)”
