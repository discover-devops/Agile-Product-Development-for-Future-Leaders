#  **What is a Product?**

* A **Product** is **anything that solves a problem or creates value for a user**.
* It can be **tangible** (like an iPhone) or **digital** (like Amazon app, Google Maps, Netflix).
* A product is **continuous** — it evolves over time with updates, new features, and customer needs.

 Key: A product is not just *built once and finished* — it **lives as long as users find value in it**.

---

# **What is a Project?**

* A **Project** is a **temporary endeavor** with a defined **start date, end date, and objective**.
* Projects are about **executing tasks** — they start, finish, and deliver something (like a feature, a campaign, or a release).
* Once completed, the project **ends**, but the product **continues to exist**.

 Key: A project is just a *vehicle* to deliver *something for the product*.

#  **Difference – Product vs Project**

| Aspect         | Product                                    | Project                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Solves a problem, delivers ongoing value   | Temporary effort to achieve a goal       |
| **Lifecycle**  | Continuous, evolves with user needs        | Has start and end date                   |
| **Focus**      | Long-term vision and customer value        | Execution of a specific deliverable      |
| **Success**    | Measured by adoption, growth, satisfaction | Measured by on-time, on-budget delivery  |
| **Ownership**  | Product Manager (custodian of vision)      | Project Manager (custodian of execution) |

#  **Example: Amazon**

Let’s apply this to Amazon 

### **Amazon as a Product**

* **Amazon.com** is a **product (actually, ecosystem of products)**.
* Vision: “Make online shopping fast, reliable, and convenient.”
* Continuous evolution:

  * Started with selling **books** → expanded into **everything** → added **Prime**, **Kindle**, **AWS**, **Alexa**.
* Success metric: How many customers use it, repeat orders, customer satisfaction, Prime memberships.

### **Amazon Projects**

* Launching **1-Click Checkout** → A project to simplify the payment flow.
* Building **Amazon Prime Video** → A project to add entertainment.
* Setting up **a new data center in India** → A project within AWS.
* Once these projects are completed, Amazon (the product) incorporates them and continues to grow.

#  **Example – Amazon**

* **Amazon.com (Product):**

  * Vision: “Make online shopping fast and convenient.”
  * Evolves: Books → Electronics → Prime → AWS → Alexa.
  * Continuous journey — still evolving.

* **Amazon Projects:**

  * Building “1-Click Checkout” (a project).
  * Launching “Prime Video” (a project).
  * Setting up AWS Data Centers (a project).

All these **projects feed into Amazon (the product)**, but the **product continues long after projects finish**.
