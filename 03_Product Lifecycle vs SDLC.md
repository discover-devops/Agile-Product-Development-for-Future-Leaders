#  **Product Lifecycle vs SDLC**

##  **Product Lifecycle**

* **Definition:** The *business journey* of a product from birth to retirement.
* **Focus:** *Market, users, value, revenue.*
* **Phases:**

  1. **Idea / Introduction** → Identifying problem & opportunity.
  2. **Growth** → Adoption increases, product scales.
  3. **Maturity** → Stable usage, competition, incremental improvements.
  4. **Decline / Retirement** → Demand falls, product is phased out.

 It’s **strategic + market-driven.**

##  **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

* **Definition:** The *engineering process* of building software.
* **Focus:** *Technology, development, quality.*
* **Phases:**

  1. Requirement Gathering
  2. Planning
  3. Design
  4. Implementation (Coding)
  5. Testing
  6. Deployment
  7. Maintenance

 It’s **execution + technology-driven.**

##  **Key Difference**

* **Product Lifecycle = Outside View** (business, users, market).
* **SDLC = Inside View** (how engineers actually build it).
* They complement each other.

##  **Example – Amazon Prime**

* **Product Lifecycle:**

  * Introduction → Launch Prime (fast shipping + video).
  * Growth → Add Music, Reading, exclusive deals.
  * Maturity → Price increases, bundle more features.
  * Decline (maybe years later) → Replace with new loyalty model.

* **SDLC:**

  * For each Prime feature (e.g., Prime Video), engineers follow SDLC:

    * Gather requirements (streaming service),
    * Plan,
    * Design UI,
    * Code backend + app,
    * Test streaming quality,
    * Deploy to users,
    * Maintain with updates.
