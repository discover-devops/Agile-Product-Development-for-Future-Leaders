**Product Managers are deeply involved in the *business design* of products**, but let’s clarify what that means:

###  What PMs Do in Business Design

* **Define the Product Vision & Strategy** → Why does this product exist? What problem does it solve?
* **Market Research** → Who are the users? What’s the competition doing?
* **Business Model** → How will the product make money? (subscriptions, ads, freemium, etc.)
* **Success Metrics** → How do we measure success? Revenue, adoption, retention, NPS, etc.
* **Prioritization** → What features deliver maximum business + customer value first?

 In simple terms: **PM = CEO of the product**. They design *what to build* and *why*, while engineering decides *how to build it*.

###  What PMs Don’t Typically Do Alone

* They don’t write the code (Engineering’s job).
* They don’t design the pixels (UX/UI Designers’ job).
* They don’t run campaigns (Marketing’s job).

But PMs **align all these roles** to ensure the **business design** translates into an actual product.

# **Example – Amazon Prime**

* **Business Design (PM responsibility):**

  * Vision: Increase customer loyalty by bundling services.
  * Model: Subscription (₹1499/year).
  * Metrics: Renewal rate, customer lifetime value, basket size.

* **Execution (Engineering + Design):**

  * Build Prime Video app, faster delivery features, exclusive deals.

So — the **business design (vision, strategy, monetization)** is very much the PM’s job.
