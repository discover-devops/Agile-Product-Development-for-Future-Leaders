### **1. Idea (Discovery Stage)**

* **Problem:** In 2008, two Bain consultants in Delhi (Deepinder Goyal & Pankaj Chaddah) noticed colleagues spending a lot of time waiting for printed restaurant menus.
* **Idea:** “What if menus were available online for everyone?”
* **Vision:** Make restaurant discovery and food info accessible online.

### **2. Build (Development Stage)**

* Built a simple website called **Foodiebay** → uploaded scanned restaurant menus.
* Early version = just menus + basic details.
* This was the **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product).

---

### **3. Launch (Go-to-Market Stage)**

* Officially launched in Delhi NCR → students & young professionals adopted it quickly.
* Marketing was mostly **word-of-mouth + small campaigns**.
* In 2010, rebranded to **Zomato** to go global.

---

### **4. Scale (Growth & Maturity Stage)**

* Expanded beyond menus → reviews, ratings, photos, food delivery, table bookings.
* Raised funding, scaled to multiple countries.
* Introduced **Zomato Gold / Pro / Blinkit acquisition**.
* Today: multi-service platform (food delivery, groceries, dine-out deals).

---

### **5. Retire (Decline / Sunset Stage)**

* Over time, some experiments didn’t work:

  * **Zomato Whitelabel** (white-label app for restaurants) → Retired.
  * **Zomato USA operations** → shut down due to heavy competition.
  * **Zomato Pro** loyalty program → retired in 2022, replaced by **Zomato Gold (revamped)**.

 Lesson: Products evolve — some features scale, others retire.
