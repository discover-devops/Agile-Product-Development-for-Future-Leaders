### **1. Idea (Discovery Stage)**

* Starts with identifying a **problem** or **opportunity**.
* Activities:

  * Market research, user interviews.
  * Brainstorming solutions.
  * Business case: *“Is it worth solving?”*
* Example (Amazon): Jeff Bezos noticed growing internet usage → idea of selling books online.

---

### **2. Build (Development Stage)**

* Convert idea into a **working product** (MVP – Minimum Viable Product).
* Activities:

  * Define requirements, create product roadmap.
  * Design + develop features.
  * Testing early versions with real users.
* Example (Amazon): Built the first website to sell books with basic catalog + checkout.

---

### **3. Launch (Go-to-Market Stage)**

* Introduce the product to real users.
* Activities:

  * Marketing campaigns, product demo, initial release.
  * Collect early feedback (alpha/beta users).
* Example (Amazon): Launched online bookstore in 1995 → marketed as *“Earth’s biggest bookstore.”*

---

### **4. Scale (Growth & Maturity Stage)**

* Product gains adoption, revenue, and user base grows.
* Activities:

  * Add new features, optimize performance.
  * Expand to new markets or customer segments.
  * Compete aggressively with rivals.
* Example (Amazon): From books → electronics → Prime → AWS → Alexa → global expansion.

---

### **5. Retire (Decline/End Stage)**

* When product no longer delivers value or market shifts.
* Activities:

  * Phase-out, migrate users to newer solutions.
  * Decide to sunset or pivot product.
* Example (Amazon): Retired **Amazon Dash buttons** (physical reorder devices) when Alexa voice ordering became popular.
